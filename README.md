# 🌏 Capacity Building on IT Scripting & Programming for Climate Services

**Project:** SPREP ClimSA 2025 Capacity Building Program  
**Target Audience:** National Meteorological & Hydrological Services (NMHSs) in the Pacific Region

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the official training materials and source codes for the **"Capacity Building Curriculum on IT Scripting & Programming for Climate Services"**. Ideally designed for climate professionals, it provides practical scripts for data processing, system integration, and workflow automation using **Python**, **R**, and **Shell Scripting**.

## 🚀 Key Features
This repository covers practical solutions for operational climate services:

* **Heterogeneous Data Integration**: Merging station observations with gridded data (NetCDF/GRIB) [Module 2]
* **Quality Control (QC)**: Automated error detection and outlier filtering algorithms [Module 3]
* **System Integration**: Script-based connection to **CliDE/CliDEsc** systems and DB querying [Module 5]
* **Automated Reporting**: Generating monthly climate analysis reports (PDF/HTML) [Module 6]
* **Workflow Automation**: End-to-end analysis pipelines using Cron and Shell scripting [Module 6]

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Languages**: Python 3.x, R 4.x, Bash Shell
* **Libraries**: `xarray`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `ggplot2`, `sqlalchemy`
* **Data Formats**: NetCDF, GRIB, CSV, SQL
